An overview of our VisualHints environment. The agent starts at the "driveway" where it only receives the textual observation. From this textual observation, the agent can issue the command "examine hint" to obtain the visual hint shown on the top-right. If the agent does not use the visual hint and simply tries to use textual observation, then it is likely to venture in a wrong path "driveway"->"street"->"supermarket" due to partial observability. Using both text and visual observation (after picking up the hint), the agent has a better context to reach the "kitchen" (goal room to make the meal). However, using both visual and textual information is a challenge and our environment design necessitates usage of both these information, that requires solving novel problem settings compared to existing works for multimodal RL.

## Dependencies installation
It is recommended to use a Anaconda + virtual environment. We assume CUDA10 (found in `/usr/loca/cuda`) is installed.<br /> 
Please change the command according to your CUDA version, which can be found at `https://pytorch.org/`.
```bash
pip install gym 
pip install tqdm pillow
pip install textworld==1.3.2
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
```

## Format for using the VisuaHints environment

The following code snippet shows basic usage of the VisualHints environment.

```
from tw_cooking_game_puzzle.visual_hints import VisualHints
env = VisualHints(path, request_infos, batch_size, asynchronous, distance_of_puzzle, add_death_room, 
                  clue_first_room, max_number_inaccessible_rooms, room_name, color_way, upgradable_color_way,
                  name_type, draw_passages, draw_player, level_clue, random_place, name)
```

The meaning of the input options are as follows:
```
- <path>                : Path to environment Textworld file.
- <request_infos>       : Additional infos requested from the game.
- <distance_of_puzzle>  : Distance of hint from the kitchen (final room).
- <add_death_room>      : Whether to add death room (agent dies in death room).
- <clue_first_room>     : Whether the visual hints can be found in the first room.
- <room_name>           : Should room name be displayed in the visual hints.
- <color_way>           : Should the way to the kitchen be highlighted.
- <name_type>           : Whether to use roomnames or number for room title.
- <draw_passages>       : Whether to show open passage between rooms.
- <draw_player>         : Should the current position of the player be drawn.
```

## How to generate games:
**Mode 1**: The goal of the agent is to reach the kitchen room, where the agent has to prepare the meal and eat the meal to win the game.
```
env = VisualHints(path=path, request_infos=request_infos, batch_size=1, asynchronous=True, mask=False, 
                  distance_of_puzzle=4, add_death_room=False, clue_first_room=True, max_number_inaccessible_rooms=2, 
                  room_name=True, color_way=True, upgradable_color_way=True, name_type='literal', draw_passages=True, 
                  draw_player=True, level_clue='easy', random_place=True, name='cooking_game')
```

**Mode 2**: Adding death room to VisualHints to emulate the role of safety in the real world. The modified goal of the agent is to reach the kitchen room while avoiding going to the death-room. The agent dies and the game is over if the agent visits the death-room.
```
env = VisualHints(path=path, request_infos=request_infos, batch_size=1, asynchronous=True, 
                  mask=False, distance_of_puzzle=4, add_death_room=True, clue_first_room=True,
                  max_number_inaccessible_rooms=2, room_name=True, color_way=True, upgradable_color_way=True,
                  name_type='literal', draw_passages=True, draw_player=True, level_clue='easy', random_place=True, name='cooking_game')
```
![option2](./assets/option_2.png)

**Mode 3**: Masked configuration of the game where only the pathway to the kitchen is highlighted and other details are masked. This will make it easier for the agent to reach the target which is the kitchen in this case. However, even the death room is masked and hence it is dangerous for the agent to deviate from the shown green pathway.
```
env = VisualHints(path=path, request_infos=request_infos, batch_size=1, asynchronous=True, 
                  mask=False, distance_of_puzzle=4, add_death_room=True, clue_first_room=True,
                  max_number_inaccessible_rooms=2, room_name=True, color_way=True, upgradable_color_way=True,
                  name_type='literal', draw_passages=True, draw_player=True, level_clue='easy', random_place=False, name='cooking_game')
```
![option3](./assets/option_3.png)


**Mode 4**: Name of the room is masked and only the room importance is displayed. For the primary target~(kitchen) the room importance is kept at 1 and for secondary targets (like rooms where the ingredients need to be picked from) are shown with importance of 2. All other rooms are shown with importance of 0.
```
env = VisualHints(path=path, request_infos=request_infos, batch_size=1, asynchronous=True, 
                  mask=False, distance_of_puzzle=4, add_death_room=True, clue_first_room=True,
                  max_number_inaccessible_rooms=2, room_name=True, color_way=True, upgradable_color_way=True,
                  name_type='room_importance', draw_passages=True, draw_player=True, level_clue='easy', random_place=False, name='cooking_game')
```
![option4](./assets/option_4.png)

**Mode 5**: The pathways between each room are masked and the agent cannot have a notion of which direction is available for travel only from the visual hint. In such a case, the multi-modal agent has to rely on the textual observation to ascertain which direction has an open door and thus decide to take action accordingly.
```
env = VisualHints(path=path, request_infos=request_infos, batch_size=1, asynchronous=True, 
                  mask=False, distance_of_puzzle=4, add_death_room=True, clue_first_room=True,
                  max_number_inaccessible_rooms=2, room_name=True, color_way=True, upgradable_color_way=True,
                  name_type='room_importance', draw_passages=False, draw_player=True, level_clue='easy', random_place=False, name='cooking_game')
```
![option5](./assets/option_5.png)

**Mode 6**: Combines the previous two modes where the pathways between each room are masked in addition to the roomnames being replaced with room importance.
```
env = VisualHints(path=path, request_infos=request_infos, batch_size=1, asynchronous=True, 
                  mask=False, distance_of_puzzle=4, add_death_room=True, clue_first_room=True,
                  max_number_inaccessible_rooms=2, room_name=True, color_way=False, upgradable_color_way=True,
                  name_type='literal', draw_passages=False, draw_player=True, level_clue='easy', random_place=False, name='cooking_game')
```
